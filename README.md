- Korea Univ. (Graduate School) / Network Simulation / ECE645 / 2023 Fall
- Reinforcement Learning
- Lecture by Prof. Hwangnam Kim, School of Eletrical Engineering, Korea University
- The folders which start from 'ch' is based on my Reference Book [Reinforcement Learning using Stable Baselines](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001762550), which was written by Prof. Yousung Park in Department of Statistics at Korea University.
- The folders which start from 'meta_rl' is based on my Reference Book [Meta-Learning for Everyone](https://github.com/dongminlee94/meta-learning-for-everyone).
